To solve this, check if the component is still mounted before accessing the state or props in the cleanup function.  This is done by introducing a ref to track the component's mount status. Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const isMounted = useRef(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    let intervalId;
    intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      if (isMounted.current) {
        setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
      }
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      isMounted.current = false;
      clearInterval(intervalId);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

By setting `isMounted.current` to `false` in the cleanup function and checking it before updating the state, you prevent any errors from accessing the state after the component is unmounted.
